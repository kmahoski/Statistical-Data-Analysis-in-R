stem(cyclesToFailure, scale = 2)

# b
length(cyclesToFailure)
5 / 70
# No, because only 5 from 70 have survived in more than 2000 cycles.
# Therefore, from the given data we can conclude that the probability is 5 / 70,
# which is approximately 0.071 = 7.1%, which can be considered a low probability.
