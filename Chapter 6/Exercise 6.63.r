# In this case, at first look, one can say that the points are close to
# the line, i.e. the distribution is normal. However, there is one
# extreme outlier - for the observation of 74.015. If that outlier didn't
# exist in the sample, we would conclude that the sample has normal
# distribution with dispersion smaller than 1 (the dispersion of the
# distribution N(0, 1) with which the sample's distribution is compared,
# because the angle between the slope of the line is greater than Ï€/4
# (its slope is greater than 1).
